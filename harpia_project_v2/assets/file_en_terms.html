        <strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong> <p>
        Eng By downloading or using the app, these terms will
        automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
        that you read them carefully before using the app.
    </p> <p>
        Harpia is committed to ensuring that the app is
        as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
        reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
        its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
        charge you for the app or its services without making it very
        clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
    </p> <p>
        The DT78 app stores and processes personal data that
        you have provided to us, in order to provide my
        Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and
        access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
        not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
        removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
        official operating system of your device. It could make your
        phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs
    </p> <!----> <p>
        You should be aware that there are certain things that Harpia will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app may require certain permissions, but Harpia cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t grant the requested permissions.
    </p> <p></p><p>
        Along the same lines, Harpia cannot always take
        responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
        make sure that your device stays charged.
    </p> <p>
        With respect to Harpia’s responsibility for your
        use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
        bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is
        updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
        to provide information to us so that we can make it available
        to you.
    </p> <p>
        At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
        currently available on Android – the requirements for
        system(and for any additional systems we
        decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
        and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
        using the app. Harpia does not promise that it
        will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
        and/or works with the Android version that you have
        installed on your device. However, you promise to always
        accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
        also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
        it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
    </p> <p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p> <p>
        I may update our Terms and Conditions
        from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
        periodically for any changes. I will
        notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and
        Conditions on this page.
    </p> <p>
        These terms and conditions are effective as of 2023-04-19
